# Bus-Tracking-Exercise
## Proof that some of the brightest minds in the country are just a few bus stops apart. Track the bus route and stops between Harvard and MIT by clicking "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard".

### For future improvements, I'll be adding in code so that the route taken is highlighted as the tracker moves across the map.
